If you've got a list of people and you'd like to publish them on the web as Linked Open Data, MicroAuthority is a simple, bare-bones system that provides an API, search, and other tools for developers and digital researchers.

MicroAuthority creates both HTML & Linked Open Data endpoints for institutional Agent authority filesâ€”lists of people, organizations, and groups. Data is provided by the institution as a CSV file. MicroAuthority automatically creates a unique URI for every row in that CSV file that works as both a webpage and as machine-readable Linked Open Data.
