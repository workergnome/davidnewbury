This is the Browse Application for the American Art Collaborative, a Mellon and IMLS-funded consortium of 14 art museums in the United States committed to establishing a critical mass of linked open data (LOD) on the semantic web.

This site allows objects and artists from across the 14 partner institutions to be explored through one interface. To design and develop a usable application for exploring the collected data, the project established a Browse Working Group, involving six of the 14 institutions and led by Design for Context, who developed this demonstration application.

This application is designed to explore techniques for building large scale web applications on top of heterogeneous linked data. One of the major complications of using Linked Data in this way is that it is not traditionally designed to function as quickly as we've become accustomed to.
